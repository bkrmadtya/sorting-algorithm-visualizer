        Algorithm can be defined as a set of steps to accomplish a given task.
        Its purpose is to make is easier to replicate doing the task again and be efficient and accurate to the same degree.
        The term ‘Algorithm’ is derived from the name of 9th century Persian sci-entist, astronomer,
        and mathematician Abdullah Muhammad bin Musa al-Khwarizimi who is also regarded as
        ‘The father of Algebra’.

        Algorithm can be found everywhere in day-to-day life.
        The primitive form of algorithm began with calculating and at the present time,
        it is being used in complex study and operation such as artificial intelligence,
        computer processing, gaming, molecular biology, and various other scientific research areas.
        It can be as simple as steps to turn on and off a light switch to any mathematical or computational operations.
        It is used primarily for calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning.The importance of algorithm arises once quality and efficiency are key factors to be considered while accomplishing any tasks.
        Opposite of following an algorithmic process is performing the same task, each time in different and unique manner.
        This introduces unreliability, inefficiency and increases time, energy, cost, and many other factors.
        Thus, use of algorithm helps eliminate these hurdles, brings consistency, efficiency and quality which is visible as the result.

        Algorithm is related to function and sometimes they are even used interchangeably but they are still not same.
        While an algorithm is a set of ideas or an abstract concept that elaborates on how to solve a problem,
        and functions are the actual implementation of the algorithm which can be used to solve them.
        Hence, a function can be an implementation of a whole algorithm or a single or multiple steps of an algorithm.
